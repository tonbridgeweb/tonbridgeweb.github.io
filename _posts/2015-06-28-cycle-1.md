This will be our first road cycling meetup heading to the awesome Velo House in Tunbridge Wells via a relatively quiet round route including a brief pause at Groombridge.

- Expected average speed: 13-16 mph (Road/racer bike strongly advised) 
- Bike padlocks are provided free at The Velo House where we will pause for drinks and food before returning <a href="http://www.thevelohouse.com" target="_blank">http://www.thevelohouse.com</a>
- Anticipated departure from Tonbridge will be 9:00 am
- Upward gradients on this route are variable but no steep climbs greater than a mile
- On approaching Groombridge we will follow the main road down the hill ending at a mini-roundabout. You can hit quite a speed on this section so please take care and maintain a safe distance between other riders/road users.
